`d-tracer` is a dissonance index measurement and tracing tool.

It requires a score in symbolic format, a soundfile synchronized with the
score, and a plotting software (yet to be decided).

## CAUTION

This is very much in the works right now. YMMV.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'd-tracer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install d-tracer
